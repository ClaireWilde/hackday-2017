#Care home inspections

![Large care home providers, by proportion of failing homes](https://github.com/ClaireWilde/hackday-2017/blob/master/socialcare/Care%20Homes.png)

Our hackday team has been looking into the quality of companies which run care homes.

We began with data from the <a href="http://www.cqc.org.uk/">Care Quality Commission</a>, the body which inspects care homes in England. This gives care providers one of four ratings: Outstanding, Good, Requires Improvement and Inadequate. It gives separate ratings in five key areas: whether a home is caring, effective, responisve, safe, and well-led. It also gives an overall rating.

We used this data to find the companies with the highest proportion of failing care homes.

Looking only at providers who run 20 or more homes, and analysing their overall inspection results, we created an interactive table showing those with the highest number of failing care homes at the top.

This brought up some interesting results: for example, Derbyshire County Council was the fifth worst performer, with around half of its care homes failing inspections.

We built an interactive tool, so people can search for a care provider they have a particular interst in, for example.

It can also focus on one particular 'key question'. This way, we can take a look at which big care home providers are the least safe, or the least well-managed.
